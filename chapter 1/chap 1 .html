        <h2>So what is a Flying Dutchman's burger?</h2>
        <p>The Flying Dutchman Burger is a minimalist yet iconic burger that gained fame through the fast-food chain In-N-Out Burger. It was invented as part of In-N-Out's secret menu, which has become a cult favorite among fans. The burger is famous for its simplicityâ€”it consists of just two beef patties and two slices of cheese, with no bun or extra toppings. This no-frills approach highlights the quality of the ingredients and makes it a quick, satisfying meal for those who love bold, cheesy flavors.</p>
